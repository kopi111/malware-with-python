# malware-with-python
Create a ransomware in python decrypt  and encrypt 
This code is designed to encrypt all the files in the current working directory using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the cryptography library in Python.

First, the code imports the necessary modules, including the os and Fernet modules. It then creates an empty list to store the file names and sets the working directory to the current directory.

The code then generates a new encryption key using the Fernet.generate_key() method and saves it to a file called "thekey.key".

Next, the code loops through all the files in the current working directory, excluding certain files such as "malware.py", "thekey.key", and "decrypt.py". For each file, it reads the contents of the file, encrypts the contents using the Fernet encryption algorithm with the generated key, and writes the encrypted contents back to the file, overwriting the original contents.

Overall, this code is intended to provide a simple way to encrypt all the files in the current working directory using the Fernet encryption algorithm in Python, while excluding certain files from being encrypted. The encrypted files can only be decrypted with the same key that was generated and saved to the "thekey.key" fil
